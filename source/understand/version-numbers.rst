Version numbers
###############

To understand how Novius OS versions are numbered, let's take a closer look at this sample release: Dubrovka 4.1.2

* The first part (Dubrovka 4) is the major version. Novius OS major versions are numbered and also named after a city to be easier to identify (in alphabetical order, e.g. 'D' is the 4th letter of the alphabet). Major versions bring new featuresfor both end users and developers, bug fixes and breaking changes often occur.
* The second part (1) is the in-between version. In-between versions mainly bring bug fixes and small improvements, although new minor features might be available too. Breaking changes don't occur.
* The last part (2) is the minor version. Minor versions are security or bug-fixing releases only. They don't bring new features and are therefore transparent to the end user. Updating is straightforward.

.. note::
  Prior to Novius OS Dubrovka, version numbers didn't fully follow the pattern described above.
